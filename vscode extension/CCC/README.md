# Code Commenting Convention (CCC)

**CCC (Code Commenting Convention)** is a lightweight VS Code extension that helps developers write **clear, structured, and consistent comments** in their code.  
Inspired by *Conventional Commits*, CCC standardizes comment tags with **emoji support** and works across **all programming languages**.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔹 Smart Autocompletion
CCC automatically suggests comment tags as you type comment characters like:
// /* -- ; % <!--

All supported CCC tags appear instantly, just like VS Code keywords.

### 🔹 Hover Descriptions
Hover over a tag (e.g., `TODO`, `FIXME`, `SECURITY`) to see its **meaning and emoji**.

### 🔹 Universal Language Support
Works in **JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, SQL, HTML, Bash, Ruby, and more**.

### 🔹 Zero Configuration
Install and start using it immediately — no setup required.
